# RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program ‚Äì IIT Gandhinagar & VSD

Welcome to my **RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program** repository!  
This repository contains all my **weekly tasks, notes, and learnings** from the program conducted by [VLSI System Design (VSD)](https://www.vlsisystemdesign.com/).

The program focuses on **RISC-V based SoC design**, from **RTL design to physical design and tapeout**, using **open-source and commercial EDA tools**.

> **From Silicon to Sovereignty**  
> A first-of-its-kind initiative by **Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar (IITGn)** and **VLSI System Design (VSD)** to empower students, educators, and professionals with **end-to-end RISC-V SoC design expertise** ‚Äî from RTL to **real silicon fabrication**.

## üìå Program Overview

The **RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program** is a **20-week hands-on training** designed to teach the **complete chip design flow** using **Synopsys EDA tools** and the **SCL180nm PDK**.  

The program aims to:
- Build a **scalable and replicable framework** for academic tapeouts across India.
- Train engineers to **go beyond simulations and fabricate actual chips**.
- Produce **job-ready VLSI professionals** aligned with India‚Äôs semiconductor self-reliance mission.

### **Key Outcomes**
- Design, implement, and fabricate a **RISC-V System-on-Chip (SoC)**.
- Gain hands-on experience with **open-source and commercial EDA tools**.
- Develop a **reusable, production-grade methodology** for future academic tapeouts.

> **‚ÄúOne Tapeout Per Student‚Äù** ‚Äî enabling every engineer to experience the **complete chip design lifecycle**.
